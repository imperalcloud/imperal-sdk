"""Narration guardrail — language-agnostic anti-fabrication system-prompt postamble.

Context (federal-grade, v1.5.24)
================================

v2.0.0: the final narration round of a chat turn is an LLM call run
kernel-side by the Webbee Narrator that turns the actual
``_functions_called`` list into a user-facing response. Before v1.5.24 (in
the pre-v2 ChatExtension era) the narration LLM occasionally
**fabricated** actions that never ran — e.g. claiming "I archived 3
emails and deleted the spam folder" when only ``mail.list`` had actually
been invoked. This is a federal compliance breach (audit-trail divergence
from reality). The guardrail applies identically whether the caller is
the Webbee Narrator's platform LLM or a user's BYO LLM.

The fix is **preventive and structural**, not detective:

1. Every narration LLM call carries a strict postamble appended to its
   ``system`` prompt. The postamble states the non-negotiable rule in
   plain language and shows the authoritative ``FUNCTIONS_CALLED`` list
   inline.
2. The rule is language-agnostic — no regex, no vocabulary matching,
   no per-language detection. It works for any user language.
3. The ``_functions_called`` list is the single source of structural
   truth — built by ``_execute_function`` inside ``handler.py`` and
   never written by the narration LLM.

Non-goals
---------
- We do NOT try to *detect* fabrication post-hoc with regex or token
  matching (that path was tried in kernel commit ``d66db64`` and
  reverted — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-chat-ext-inner-truth-gate-design.md`).
- We do NOT mandate a specific output format (plain text, markdown,
  JSON) — just forbid invention.

Exports
-------
- ``STRICT_NARRATION_POSTAMBLE``   : the raw rule text (format-string)
- ``format_functions_called_summary`` : render fc-list → human-readable bullets
- ``augment_system_with_narration_rule`` : returns ``system + postamble``

Invariants
----------
- **I-NARRATION-STRICT-1**: every narration LLM call in SDK goes through
  ``augment_system_with_narration_rule``. No direct system-only call.
- **I-NARRATION-STRICT-2**: postamble text is frozen and identical in
  every language — it describes the rule, never parrots a message back.

STRICT NARRATION RULE (federal-grade, non-negotiable):
You are describing operations in the FUNCTIONS_CALLED list below. You MUST:
1. Describe ONLY operations explicitly present in FUNCTIONS_CALLED.
2. NEVER claim, imply, suggest, or mention any operation that is not in FUNCTIONS_CALLED \
— regardless of the user's request.
3. If an operation is in FUNCTIONS_CALLED with status=error, describe it as failed honestly. \
Do not soften or fabricate success.
4. If FUNCTIONS_CALLED is empty, describe the inability to act — do not invent any actions.
5. This rule applies to every language (English, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish, Hebrew, \
German, Chinese, Arabic, or any other).
