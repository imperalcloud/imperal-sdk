"""Federal-Grade Chat Integrity — emit_narration tool contract (P2 Task 18).

Structural foundation for Component 1 (Narration Contract Hybrid). v2.0.0:
the kernel-side Webbee Narrator injects ``EMIT_NARRATION_TOOL`` into every
chat turn and requires the LLM to call it to terminate the turn with
narrated prose. The LLM cannot fabricate — every claim made in
``per_call_verdicts`` is structurally verified against ``_functions_called``
by the kernel before the response reaches the user.

Spec: ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-federal-grade-chat-integrity-design.md``
§3.2 (Narration Contract Hybrid).

----

Relation to ``imperal_sdk/chat/narration_guard.py`` (soft-rule postamble,
v1.5.24): that module appended a natural-language instruction to the system
prompt telling the LLM to stay honest — a *soft* guardrail. This new module
is the *structural* replacement. A tool-call is forced, its shape is
machine-checkable, and the kernel enforces consistency post-hoc regardless of
what the LLM tried to emit in prose. Deprecation of ``narration_guard.py`` is
handled by Task 27 when the handler wires ``emit_narration`` through — this
module does not touch ``narration_guard.py``.

----

**Schema design decision: Option A (keep ``minimum: 0`` on integer fields).**

The spec plan offered Option A (keep ``minimum: 0``, accept OpenAI non-strict
degradation) vs Option B (drop ``minimum: 0`` so both Anthropic and OpenAI
can run strict mode, and enforce ``>= 0`` at the Pydantic layer).

Option A wins here because the schema contains ``identifiers_used`` which is
*intentionally optional* (not in top-level ``required``). The kernel's
``_is_oai_strict_eligible`` (see ``imperal_kernel/llm/adapter.py``) requires
that every property be listed in ``required[]`` — so this schema is
**already ineligible** for OpenAI strict mode regardless of whether we keep
``minimum``. Dropping ``minimum`` would surrender a defense-in-depth wire
validation on the Anthropic path and buy nothing on the OpenAI path.

We therefore keep the wire-level ``minimum: 0`` AND enforce ``ge=0`` at the
Pydantic parser layer. Two layers of defense — Anthropic validates at the
provider boundary, kernel validates after parse.

----

Invariants (see spec §3.2):

- **I-NARRATION-TOOL-SHAPE-1**: ``EMIT_NARRATION_TOOL`` shape is frozen —
  changes require spec update + kernel verifier update.
- **I-NARRATION-TOOL-REQUIRED-1**: ``mode``, ``prose``, ``per_call_verdicts``,
  ``task_targets`` are required; ``identifiers_used`` is optional.
- **I-NARRATION-STATUS-ENUM-1**: verdict status is one of
  ``{"success", "error", "intercepted"}`` — must match kernel's
  ``_functions_called[*].status`` vocabulary.
- **I-NARRATION-FROZEN-1**: parsed ``NarrationEmission`` is immutable
  (Pydantic ``frozen=True``) — no post-parse tampering.
