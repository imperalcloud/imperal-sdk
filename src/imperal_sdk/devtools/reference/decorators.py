"""``decorator`` kind — ``chat.function`` + the ``ext.*`` decorator methods.

Qualified ``chat.function`` (on ChatExtension) and ``ext.<name>`` (on
Extension). ``self`` is dropped. Any listed name that is absent or not a plain
decorator method (e.g. a property) degrades to a noted placeholder rather than
crashing — the completeness gate (T6) then records it with a reason.
